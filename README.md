# Hybrid Predictive Analysis Framework for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Diagnosis

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and early prediction models. This project develops a hybrid predictive analysis framework that integrates metaheuristic optimization techniques with mathematical modeling to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CAD diagnosis. The proposed system leverages patient clinical data, demographic factors, and lifestyle attributes to create predictive models.

## Metaheuristic Algorithms
Metaheuristic algorithms such as **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** are implemented as hyperparameter tuning functions to optimize model parameters, addressing the challenges of high-dimensional datasets. 

## Mathematical Models
Mathematical models, including **logistic regression** and **support vector machines (SVM)**, are integrated to ensure interpretability and clinical relevance.

## Approach and Validation
The hybrid approach is validated using publicly available datasets and evaluated on metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. 

## Results
The results demonstrate that the system achieves faster results compared to traditional hyperparameter tuning methods. Additionally, a secondary aim of this project was to experiment with **GA** and **PSO** for hyperparameter tuning, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness in optimizing machine learning models for medical predictions.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the potential of combining metaheuristics with mathematical modeling to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CAD risk prediction, ultimately reducing healthcare costs.
